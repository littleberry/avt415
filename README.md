# AVT 415-001 | AVT 519-003
Faculty site code repository (repo) for my AVT415 and 519 courses at GMU, Fall 2106

Code for all demos and lessons will end up here.

If you know what you are doing with GitHub: fork or clone the repo.

If you don't know what you are doing: Use the big green button that says 'Clone or Download' to download the entire repo as a zip file. Save the downloaded file to where you want to work with your files and unzip the file. It should create a set of folders and files with the repo code.
